Portfolio Creation - Demonstrating my web development skills by building a webpage.


This milestone project takes place at the end of the web designer unit of the program. It's meant to put into practice skills learned in courses 2 (HTML & Web Accessibility), 3 (CSS, SASS, & CSS Frameworks), 4 (User Experience & User Interface Design), and 5 (JavaScript & Front-End Web Development) as shown in the chart below.

General Requirements:
This is a solo project!
This game must run in a web browser

Game Requirements
This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)
The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI
For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)
When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts
If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files
Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
The HTML code should use sematic tags
The game should have a Readme.md file in the Github repository that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality
Bonus Ideas
Make persistent scores in your browser's localStorage
Add interesting music or sound effects to your game
Deliverables
A link to your game, which is deployed somewhere on the internet
A link to your Github repository, so we can see the progress on your game
