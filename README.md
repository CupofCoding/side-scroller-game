# side-scroller-game

## Main Concept: 
Portfolio Creation - Demonstrating my web development skills by building a webpage.

This milestone project takes place at the end of the web designer unit of the program. It's meant to put into practice skills learned in courses 2 (HTML & Web Accessibility), 3 (CSS, SASS, & CSS Frameworks), 4 (User Experience & User Interface Design), and 5 (JavaScript & Front-End Web Development) as shown in the chart below.

### General Requirements:
- This is a solo project!
- This game must run in a web browser

### Game Project Requirements
- This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)
- The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI
- For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
- This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)
- When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts
- If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files
- Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
- The HTML code should use sematic tags
- The game should have a Readme.md file in the Github repository that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality

### Bonus Ideas
- Make persistent scores in your browser's localStorage
- Add interesting music or sound effects to your game

### Deliverables
- A link to your game, which is deployed somewhere on the internet
- A link to your Github repository, so we can see the progress on your game

## Requirements:
### Zombie game
- Backgound needs to loop and pan persistently to the right. 
- Needs a way to keep score; upper located right 
- Needs a way to keep track of lives (3 hearts/5 hearts game over condition). 
- Character needs to be stationary; in order to allow character to jump, there has to be logic for the character to persistently be falling and obstructed by the ground. 
- Character needs a swinging motion, enemy needs to register hit then death animations. 
- Enemy needs to randomize 1 hit or 2 hits to die; 2 hits requires stagger then proceeding forward animation. (Rule #2: DoubleTap)
- Need to create a way to add points to score; enemy dies; replace with floating points.
